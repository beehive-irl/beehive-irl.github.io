Embarking on a doctoral pursuit in control systems at The University of Manchester, Hilton's research trajectory received support from the Indonesia Endowment Fund (LPDP) for Education. His doctoral investigations centered on distributed coordination and estimation algorithms for robotic sensor networks. Hilton's contributions were particularly notable in devising distributed algorithms addressing motion control challenges in robots, specifically focusing on coverage control problems in unknown environments through distributed optimisation and Kalman-based estimation. His collaborative efforts resulted in publications in esteemed journals under the IEEE and Elsevier umbrellas, covering topics like bearing-based formation control, affine formation control, and fixed-time formation control. Notably, during his PhD, Hilton achieved significant recognition, securing first place in the Venture Out Research Category in 2017, along with notable placements in the Imagine Cup competitions in 2018 held by Microsoft.

Upon the completion of his PhD study, Hilton transitioned into industry, playing a pivotal role in the development of the Otaklebah middleware at Beehive Drones, a company he co-founded in 2018. His involvement extended to projects involving the operation of multiple UAVs and the implementation of website-application-based delivery systems with Navier Delivery Systems. In 2021, Hilton assumed the role of a postdoctoral researcher at the COPERNIC group in GIPSA Lab, France, where his research focused on trajectory generation and tracking techniques for multiple quadcopters. Since January 2022, Hilton has held a postdoctoral researcher position in the Geomatics Section of the Faculty of Engineering Technology at KU Leuven, Belgium. In this capacity, he contributes to the Deep Sewer project, dedicated to developing a module for the automatic mapping and inspection of sewer networks. Hilton's academic journey is underscored by numerous accolades, showcasing a profound scientific engagement that spans robotics, multi-agent systems, nonlinear control, sensor fusion, distributed estimation, and visual navigation. </p>
