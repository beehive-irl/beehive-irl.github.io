<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hilton Tnunay is the research director and a researcher at Beehive Intelligent Robotics Laboratory (BIRL). His research interests cover robotics, cooperative control of multi-agent systems, sensor fusion, and visual navigation. Hilton earned his Bachelor of Engineering degree from Universitas Gadjah Mada in Indonesia. During his undergraduate, he joined the UAV formation control research group, where he designed a formation control algorithm for UAVs exploiting the well-established potential field method. His works were published as scientific articles in international conferences and scientific journals. Upon completing his undergraduate study, Hilton received support from the Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP) to pursue his doctoral degree in control systems at The University of Manchester. His doctoral study was focused on distributed coordination and estimation algorithms for robotic sensor networks. Hilton's contributions were particularly notable in devising distributed algorithms addressing cooperative motion control challenges in robots, specifically focusing on coverage control problems in unknown environments through distributed optimisation and Kalman-based estimation. His results were published in scientific journals under the IEEE and Elsevier, covering topics like bearing-based formation control, affine formation control, and fixed-time formation control. Notably, during his PhD, Hilton also secured first place in the Venture Out Research Category in 2017, along with notable placements in the Imagine Cup competitions in 2018 held by Microsoft. In 2020, after completing his PhD, Hilton became a full-time CTO at Beehive Drones, a company he co-founded in 2018. He was involved in developing Otaklebah drone middleware, visual control and navigation of quadcopters and Navier Delivery Systems, a website-application-based drone delivery system. In 2021, Hilton assumed the role of a postdoctoral researcher at the COPERNIC group in GIPSA Lab, France, where his research focused on trajectory generation and formation control of multiple quadcopters for surveillance and object tracking. Since January 2022, Hilton has become a postdoctoral researcher in the Geomatics Section of the Faculty of Engineering Technology at KU Leuven, Belgium. In this role, he is involved in the Deep Sewer project, a project aiming to develop a sensor module for automatic sewer mapping and inspection and digital twins sewer networks. In 2022, Beehive Drones initiated the establishment of Beehive Intelligent Robotics Laboratory (BIRL), where Hilton became the Research Director and a researcher in the field of swarm intelligence.
